## Quick start (3 steps)

1) Clone and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lichengiggs/free_proxy.git
cd free_proxy
npm install
```

2) Start

```bash
npm start
```

For beginners: after running `npm start`, keep this terminal open.

3) Open the setup page and save at least one provider API key

- Visit: `http://localhost:8765`
- After saving a key, you can pick a model and start using it

## FAQ

- Network error: make sure the service is running with `npm start`, then open `http://localhost:8765`
- No available model: free models may be rate-limited temporarily; click **Refresh model list** or add a known-available model manually
- Where keys are stored: local `.env` file only (not uploaded)
